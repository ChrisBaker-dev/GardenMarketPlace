# T2A2 Christopher Baker - Marketplace Application

## R7 - Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.
---

The Farmers Marketplace application is solving two key problems:
1. It provides a place for people to purchase quality produce and herbs to combat mass farming techniques.
2. It provides a place for people who produce too much produce in their home garden to sell their quality goods to their community.

# R8 - Why is it a problem that needs solving?
---

This application is designed to compete with poor quality grocery store produce. When we shop at a chain grocery store and buy healthy food, we have found a lot of the food to not have the full taste, under ripened and is lacking in potential nutrition. Due to the need for a grocery store to have their food on a shelf for a number of days, their produce is often picked prior to being fully ripe and stored at temperatures to preserve shelf life for days on end. By connecting users with their local gardeners/farmers they will not only receive a higher quality product, they will also find a lot more variety in produce. 

This application aims to connect people with local home gardeners/farmers who can provide the high quality taste, nutrition and price with their products.
